# 2D-Heat-Transfer
In this repository, I have demonstrated various methods to solve 2D-heat Transfer problems, using MATLAB.I have used various methods from numerical to analytical method.  

  Here is the simulation of soving steady state temperature distribution in a square plate mainted at constant temperatures at edges.
